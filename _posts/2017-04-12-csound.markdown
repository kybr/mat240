With general purpose (programming) languages we use libraries and frameworks to delve into some specific domain. But when the language itself takes on the vocabulary of a domain, offering special treatment of the common goals, challenges, and tasks of a particular domain, the we might call that language a [DSL (domain specific language)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language).

# Music DSLs

[Max Mathews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Mathews) [MUSIC-N](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUSIC-N) family launguages were the first Music DSLs.

Any Music DSL must offer some treatment of topics, structures, and tools relating to the composition (or generation) of music. A few of these might be....

- [Unit Generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_generator) (or [Opcode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opcode))
- [Algorithmic composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_composition)
- [Envelopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthesizer#ADSR_envelope) to control the amplitude, frequency, or other parameters of notes
- Tuning/Pitch systems such as [Equal temperament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_temperament) and [Just intonation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_intonation)
- [MIDI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI), OSC
- Musical scales and transposition..
- Rhythm and time signatures: 7/8, 7/8, 7/8, 4/4... 5/8, 5/8, 5/8, 6/8
- Key signatures

## Pitch

[Pitch]() is different than [frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency).

[Scientific Pitch Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_pitch_notation)


## Loudness

[Loudness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudness) is different than [amplitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude) or [Sound Pressure Level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_pressure#Sound_pressure_level).


## Timbre

"that attribute of auditory sensation which enables a listener to judge that two nonidentical sounds, similarly presented and having the same loudness and pitch, are dissimilar"
These words are sometimes used for timbre..
- character, texture, tone color, tone quality

[Timbre]() is different than [spectrum]().

## Envelope

An [envelope]() may control any parameter, not just amplitude.
